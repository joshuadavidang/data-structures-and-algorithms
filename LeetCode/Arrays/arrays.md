## Things to look out for

- Check if there are any duplicate values in the array `[1, 1, 2, 5]`.
- When iterating through the array using index `i`, make sure the index is within the array, and not go out of bound.
- Use left and right index to go through the array if possible.

## Corner cases

- Empty array
- Array with only 1 or 2 elements
- Repeated elements in the array
- Duplicated values
